 Starting off the week with trying to see what website to clone and ending the week with a functional website was very difficult. This being the first solo project, it was very different from having groupmates to discuss every feature with you. Time management became a huge problem during the middle of the week. There were too many things to tackle and debug that it may take a few hours or more to implement one feature. Although it was a long and stressful process but being able to see the app come together makes everything worth it. I did not have much time to complete bonus features but I wanted to at least create a rich text editor that will make the app look like a note taking app. This implementation took a lot of time due to some bugs I ran into while creating the onClick on the notes to render the title and content onto the text editor. It is still being perfected but it will be cool to see when things come together.
